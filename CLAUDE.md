# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Site context

**Read `SITE-CONTEXT.md` at the start of every session.** It contains the full
doracanalcourt.com site architecture: installed plugins + versions, MotoPress data
model (cottage IDs, room type IDs, booking counts), iCal OTA feeds, cache stack,
security findings, and gotchas that affect every plugin in this repo.

Key facts from that document that affect this plugin:
- DB table prefix: `portal_` (not `wp_`)
- Room type IDs: 1065/1067/1069/1071/1604/1607/1740/1742 (8 cottages)
- Checkout page ID: 1399
- Three active cache layers (SpeedyCache Pro + HostGator Endurance + advanced-cache.php)

## Repository purpose

Two WordPress plugins for doracanalcourt.com:

- **MPHB Availability Calendar** (`mphb-availability-calendar/`) — one Elementor
  widget displaying multi-property availability for MotoPress Hotel Booking
  accommodations. No build step. Most of this file describes this plugin.
- **DCC Seasons** (`dcc-seasons/`) — date-scheduled seasonal ambient particles
  plus a tap-the-logo Matrix easter egg. See the section at the end of this file.

Both share the `dcc` admin menu and the `claude-code` Elementor category.

## Target environment

- WordPress 6.0+ (deployment site is on 6.9.x)
- PHP 8.0+ (deployment site is on 8.3.x; codebase uses 8.0-compatible syntax)
- Elementor (free, 3.5+)
- MotoPress Hotel Booking plugin must be active
- Hosted on HostGator shared hosting alongside SpeedyCache Pro

## Common commands

```bash
# Syntax-check every PHP file in the plugin
find mphb-availability-calendar -name '*.php' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 php -l

# Build the installable zip the user uploads via WP Admin → Plugins → Add New → Upload
( cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) && zip -r mphb-availability-calendar.zip mphb-availability-calendar )
```

There are no automated tests — runtime behavior can only be verified by installing the zip on a staging WordPress site. See `readme.txt` and the plan in `/root/.claude/plans/` for the manual smoke-test checklist.

## Architecture

Single-folder plugin, PSR-4-ish layout under a `MPHBAC\` namespace. Bootstrap → Plugin singleton → six collaborators.

```
mphb-availability-calendar.php       # Headers + constants + require()s + activation hook
includes/class-plugin.php            # Singleton orchestrator; registers all WP hooks
includes/class-widget.php            # Elementor_Widget_Base subclass; ~all Elementor controls live here
includes/class-data-provider.php     # Read layer over MotoPress (PHP API + SQL fallback)
includes/class-cache.php             # Thin transient wrapper (prefix mphbac_)
includes/class-cache-integration.php # SpeedyCache exclusion on activate + admin notice
includes/class-ajax.php              # Nonce-protected admin-ajax.php endpoint (action mphbac_query)
assets/css/widget.css                # CSS custom-property–driven
assets/js/widget.js                  # Vanilla JS, no jQuery dep; reads data-config from root element
```

Request flow when a visitor loads a page containing the widget:

1. `Widget::render()` outputs only the shell — heading, filters, legend, nav, an empty `.mphbac-grid-wrap` with a `.mphbac-loading` placeholder, the popups, and hidden `.mphbac-info-content` divs. It does NOT render the grid.
2. The full settings + cottage IDs (incl. per-device `daysDesktop/daysTablet/daysMobile`) are serialized into a `data-config` JSON attribute on `.mphbac-root`.
3. On load, `assets/js/widget.js` picks the day count for the current device, POSTs to `admin-ajax.php?action=mphbac_query`, and **renders the grid client-side**. It re-renders on filter/nav/swipe and when the viewport crosses a device breakpoint.
4. `Data_Provider::get_availability()` (transient-cached) backs the AJAX endpoint — the transient layer hits on repeats. The grid is intentionally client-rendered so each device shows its own day count.

## Invariants that must hold

These are deliberate decisions from the design conversation. Don't "fix" them without checking with the user.

- **All "today" math runs in US/Eastern**, not WP's site timezone. The physical cottages are in Florida and cutoffs must match the property clock regardless of visitor locale. See `Data_Provider::TZ` and `Data_Provider::timezone()`.
- **Never re-fetch iCal URLs.** MotoPress already syncs iCal feeds every 15 minutes; imported reservations land as `mphb_booking` posts (same as direct bookings). Direct iCal HTTP fetches would duplicate work and risk cron conflicts.
- **Availability is read directly from MotoPress's DB, not its PHP API.** `MPHB()->getRoomRepository()->getAvailableRooms()` proved unreliable (ignores the room-type filter in 6.x). `Data_Provider::query_occupied_room_days()` reads the real storage: `mphb_reserved_room` posts (`_mphb_room_id` meta) joined to their parent `mphb_booking` post (which carries `mphb_check_in_date` / `mphb_check_out_date` and a `post_status` in `Data_Provider::BLOCKING_STATUSES`), plus the `{prefix}mphb_blocks` table for manual host blocks. A cottage-day is "booked" only when every physical room of that type is occupied. All SQL is `$wpdb->prepare`'d; the two queries are wrapped in `try/catch (\Throwable)` with `MPHBAC:` error logging.
- **Book Now flow uses a hidden form POST to MotoPress's checkout page** (`MPHB()->settings()->pages()->getCheckoutPageUrl()`, default `/submit-booking/`). The POST body matches MotoPress's own cottage-page form exactly: `mphb_room_type_id`, `mphb_check_in_date`, `mphb_check_out_date`, `mphb_rooms_details[ID]=1`, `mphb_is_direct_booking=1`. No nonce field — MotoPress doesn't CSRF-protect this submission. Don't switch to `MPHB()->reservationRequest()` PHP-side unless you have a specific reason; the form-POST path is documented behavior and identical to what MotoPress's own UI does. Popup can be disabled globally via the `enable_popup` Elementor toggle.
- **Every visible string must be translatable.** Text domain is `mphb-availability-calendar`. The site uses Loco Translate. Use `__()`, `esc_html__()`, `esc_attr__()` etc. — never echo a raw user-facing string.
- **The Elementor widget category is `claude-code`** ("Claude Code"). It's registered in `Plugin::register_category()`. Don't change the slug — existing widgets reference it.
- **SpeedyCache exclusion is auto-managed.** `Cache_Integration::on_activate()` runs on plugin activation and adds `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=mphbac_query` to SpeedyCache's exclusion list (filter + option write). The user does not configure this manually.

## Cache layer

- Backed by WP transients, prefix `mphbac_`, default TTL 900 s (15 min — matches MotoPress's iCal sync interval).
- Keys are `sha1(wp_json_encode($parts))` so they're content-addressed and stable.
- `Cache::flush_all()` is called on `mphb_after_sync_ical`, `mphb_ical_sync_finished`, `mphb_after_create_booking`, and `mphb_booking_status_changed`. If MotoPress changes its hook name, transients still expire on TTL, so worst case is a 15-min staleness window.
- Deactivation flushes all transients.

## Adding controls or settings

Every Elementor control is registered inside one of twelve methods in `class-widget.php`, all called from `register_controls()`:

- `register_content_controls()` — heading + cottage selector
- `register_display_controls()` — per-device day count (`visible_days`, responsive), per-device day-of-week format (`dow_format`, responsive), label style, legend/past/nav toggles, font size, popup toggle, minimum nights
- `register_labels_controls()` — the custom-cottage-label repeater (`cottage_labels`)
- `register_info_controls()` — the cottage-info-popup repeater (`cottage_info`: per-cottage Elementor template or WYSIWYG text)
- `register_strings_controls()` — every editable label (incl. `str_property` corner label)
- `register_style_controls()` — theme inheritance + the three state color pickers
- `register_heading_style_controls()` — widget-heading typography + color
- `register_field_style_controls()` — filter-input typography/border/colors
- `register_calheader_style_controls()` — calendar top-row background/text + overall typography + separate day-of-week and date-of-month typography
- `register_namecol_style_controls()` — cottage-name column colors/typography/width
- `register_button_style_controls()` — button typography/border/padding + Normal/Hover colors
- `register_nav_style_controls()` — nav-arrow button + range-label colors
- `register_legend_style_controls()` — legend text color + typography
- `register_cell_style_controls()` — calendar cell radius / min-height / gap

Interactions: tapping a cottage name opens the **info popup** (`.mphbac-info-sheet`) if that cottage has a `cottage_info` row; tapping an available day opens the **booking popup** (`.mphbac-sheet`). The two popups share CSS. Per-cottage info content is server-rendered into hidden `.mphbac-info-content` divs and copied into the popup by `widget.js`.

When adding a setting:
1. Add it in the appropriate method.
2. If it changes server-rendered output, read it in `Widget::render()` and pass through `data-config` (and into `render_grid()`'s `$opts` array if the grid markup needs it).
3. If it only affects styles, use a `selectors` argument so Elementor live-preview works.
4. **Specificity:** Bravada's Elementor kit resets inputs/buttons with `(0,3,1)`-specific selectors. Style-control selectors must outrank that — use the `Widget::SEL` prefix (`{{WRAPPER}} .mphbac-root.mphbac-root `), whose doubled class reaches `(0,4,0)`. Style controls carry no defaults; the baked-in look lives in `widget.css` (controls are override-only).

## Visual design / palette

`assets/css/widget.css` bakes in a design matched to the user's Angie-built reference widget — a data-table look. Most style controls also carry these same values as Elementor-control defaults (user request — they wanted the panel to show the values). Key CSS custom properties on `.mphbac-root`:

- `--mphbac-color-available: #7BDCB5` · `--mphbac-color-booked: #FB6962` · `--mphbac-color-past: #bdc3c7`
- `--mphbac-color-header: #0A50B2` (top row) · `--mphbac-color-nav-bg: #C43A3A` · `--mphbac-color-nav-hover: #078732` (nav buttons are decoupled from the header color)
- `--mphbac-color-namecol: #F8F9FA` · `--mphbac-color-namecol-alt: #F1F3F5` (zebra stripe) · `--mphbac-color-namecol-text: #111111` · `--mphbac-color-frame: #e0e0e0`
- `--mphbac-color-legend-text: #111111` · `--mphbac-color-today-outline: #f4da62` · `--mphbac-label-width: 180px`

Grid columns: the cottage column is a fixed `--mphbac-label-width`; day columns are `minmax(0, 1fr)` so they shrink to fit (no horizontal overflow). `--mphbac-cell-min` is cell **height** only.

Site brand palette (for reference): Primary `#0f6dbf` · Secondary `#f08080`. The whole widget — filters, calendar, legend, popups — is now styled cohesively.

## Git workflow

- Active branch: `claude/dcc-seasons-plugin-2tqkxt`. Develop and push there. Don't open a PR unless the user asks.
- Root holds two plugin folders (`mphb-availability-calendar/`, `dcc-seasons/`),
  the `tools/` dev scripts, the tracked `dcc-seasons.zip` build artifact, and the
  site context docs.

## Delivering DCC Seasons zips

When sending the user an installable zip for a new **DCC Seasons** version, name
the file **`Seasons <version>.zip`** — e.g. `Seasons 3.7.0.zip`. Build it from
the `dcc-seasons/` folder as usual (the folder inside the zip keeps its own
name, which is what WordPress installs); only the delivered filename changes.

The repo keeps one tracked build artifact at `dcc-seasons.zip` so a version-named
copy isn't accumulated per release; rebuild it in the same commit as the version
bump so the tracked zip never lags the source.

## DCC Seasons — things that bite

- **Minified assets have a recorded build command.** Regenerate with exactly
  `npx terser assets/js/<name>.js -c passes=3 -m --safari10 -d __DCC_DEBUG__=false
  -o assets/js/<name>.min.js` for ambient/engine/matrix. Before 3.6.0 the engine's
  flags were unrecorded, which made one release's binary unreproducible and its
  size incomparable to the next.
- **Never run a numeric-precision regex over the sprite path data.** A trim regex
  in 3.2.0 fused compact SVG number pairs (`8.2.4` is two numbers, not one),
  silently corrupting four sprites; the corrupted output is an ordinary-looking
  number no text search can find. Run `node tools/validate-paths.js` after any
  change to `assets/js/engine.js` — it parses every `d` and exits 1 on a bad one.
- **The "behind" layering canvas is mounted inside the theme's opaque content
  column at `z-index:-1`,** not on the body. Bravada's `main.main` is
  `position:relative; z-index:9` with a white background, so no body-level
  z-index can sit between that background and the text above it. Override the
  host with the `dcc_seasons_backdrop_host` filter.
- **The schedule is rules, not dates** (`includes/class-schedule.php`). Rows are
  `{start:{on,off,m?,d?}, end:{…}, theme, label, year}`; `on` is `fixed` or a
  named anchor (`easter`, `thanksgiving`, `memorial_day`…). The SAME resolver
  exists in PHP (admin table) and in `ambient.js` (the visitor, from their local
  date — cache-safe). `scratchpad/test-schedule.js` cross-checks them for every
  anchor 2024–2035; keep both in step. Narrowest overlapping range wins its day.
  Pre-3.7.0 dated rows are migrated on read (`Schedule::migrate`).
- **Tap counting is delegated** (one document listener, `closest()` against the
  selector tiers: configured → `tapFallback` → `#masthead`, first tier with a
  VISIBLE match). Binding per element double-counted nested targets — the egg
  opened on half the configured taps until 3.7.0.
- **`?dcc_debug=1` as an administrator** prints an on-page diagnostics panel with
  the backdrop-host decision and the content column's ancestor chain. Ask the
  owner for that text before theorising about the live layering.
- **Uploading a new zip does not purge the page cache.** The client config and the
  `?ver=` asset URL are both baked into cached HTML, so the site keeps serving the
  previous build. The plugin purges itself on a version change, but verify after
  any manual/FTP deploy.
